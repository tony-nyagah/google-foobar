### What is Google's foo.bar?

Google's foo.bar is an invite only coding challenge that randomly pops up on the Google search engine.    

### Why Google's foo.bar?

Some say it's a way for Google to get new talent but apparently that's not true.    
I am using my invitation as a way to learn and test my skills.

### How does it work?

You are dropped into a terminal and given up to 5 levels of challenges from what I have seen so far.    
You can only solve 1 level at a time.    
The first level is easy but I've heard the last few are challenging with a focus on algorithms and mathematics.

### Why share?

I want to share my programming journey with others and have a place where I can look back on and appreciate the journey ðŸ˜„
